# SpiderWeb: A Spatial Interactive Data Generator on the Web
This repository provides a web-based generator for spatial data based on the award-winning Spatial Data Generator, which was presented in 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Spatial Gems (SpatialGems 2019, https://www.spatialgems.net/).
The paper received the best paper award on that year. This web demo is based on a Python implementation. SpiderWeb is publicly accessible at [https://spider.cs.ucr.edu]. This demo was published in ACM SIGSPATIAL 2020. If you use Spider, please cite our paper below.

## How to use it?
Check our [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/h0xCG6Swdqw) on how to use SpiderWeb. You can directly download the generated data from SpiderWeb or you can get a command line that generates the data using the enclosed Python implementation.

## Sample
There are six kinds of supported distribution. Please feel free to contact us if you want to have other spatial distributions.

Here are some links to some sample data.

- [1000 random rectangles in the world space](http://spider.cs.ucr.edu/?P&1000&2&&0.2&0.5&360,0,-180,0,180,-90)
- [1M random points around Los Angeles area](http://spider.cs.ucr.edu/?G&1000000&2&&point&2,0,-35,0,2,-119)
- [Reversely correlated points (x = -y)](http://spider.cs.ucr.edu/?D&500&2&2&point&0.2&0.2&-2,0,1,0,2,-1)

## Web demonstration
Spider is deployed as a web application at [https://spider.cs.ucr.edu] where you can visualize and download the datasets.

## Command line interface (CLI)
<div id="cli"></div>
Make sure that Python3 is installed. Download the [generator.py](html/cgi/generator.py) file and run it using the following command.
```shell
python3 generator.py <distribution> <cardinality> <dimensions> [geometry] [parameters]
```
The parameters are generally specified as a set of `key=value` pairs. The possible keys and their usage is described below.

- *distribution*: {uniform, diagonal, gaussian, parcel, bit, sierpinski}
- *cardinality*: Number of geometries to generate
- *dimensions*: Number of dimensions in generated geometries
- *geometry*: {point, box}. If geometry type is `box` and the distribution is NOT `parcel`, you have to specify the maxsize property
- *maxsize*: maximum size along each dimension (before transformation), e.g., 0.2,0.2 (no spaces)
- *percentage*: (for diagonal distribution) the percentage of records that are perfectly on the diagonal
- *buffer*: (for diagonal distribution) the buffer around the diagonal that additional points can be in
- *srange*: (for parcel distribution) the split range [0.0, 1.0]
- *dither*: (for parcel distribution) the amound of noise added to each record as a perctange of its initial size [0.0, 1.0]
- *affinematrix*: (optional) values of the affine matrix separated by comma. Number of expected values is d*(d+1) where d is the number of dimensions
- *compress*: (optional) { bz2 }
- *format*: output format { csv, wkt, geojson }
[affine matrix] (Optional) Affine matrix parameters to apply to all generated geometries

## Instructions to install on Apache Tomcat as a web service
### Prerequisites
1. Python3
2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

### Steps
1. Install [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi). Assume it is installed to `$CATALINA_HOME`
2. Enable [CGI scripting](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html). Edit `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml`. Uncomment the following sections and modify the configuration as shown:
```xml
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/spider/cgi/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
...
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.CGIServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>cgiPathPrefix</param-name>
        <param-value>WEB-INF/cgi</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
```
3. Edit `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/context.xml` and add `privileged="true"` at the `<Context>` element so that it looks as follows.
```xml
<Context privileged="true">
...
</Context>
```
4. Copy the `html` directory from the source code to `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/spider`.
You can do that by running the following command at the source root `rsync -av html/ $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/spider`
5. Copy the `html/cgi/generator.py` file to `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/cgi/generator.py`. You can do that by running the command `rsync -av html/cgi/ $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/cgi`
6. Restart Tomcat server.
7. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/spider/]
